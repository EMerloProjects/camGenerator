This file is an example of a complete program I wrote during an R&D project.

Althoug it is related to a specific task it contains 95% of the scripts and functions I use regularly.
Hence it is here just to serve myself as a personal python cheat sheet as to not re-invent the wheel every single time I have to write code.

Please forgive the occasional swear words and venetian dialect written in the code.
Swearing is a cultural fenomenon in my country and serves as a cathartic experience in order to relax oneself during difficult times.
Omitting those words would have taken me too much time at the risk of breaking the code itself.

(there's no private company related data in this file: the script was never commercially used, it runs exclusively on config files and LUTs that are not provided, and
was never presented to the techcnical direction (so it wasn't approved in any way also). It served only to provide a proof of concept for a new cam design, never actually implemented)
