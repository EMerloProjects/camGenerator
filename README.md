This file is an example of a comlete program I wrote during an R&D project.

Althoug it is related to a specific task it contains 95% of the scripts and functions I use regularly.
Hence it is here just to serve myself as a personal python cheat sheet as to not re-invent the wheel every single time I have to write code.

(there's no private company related data in this file: the script was never commercially used, it runs exclusively on config files and LUTs that are not provided, and
was never presented to the techcnical direction (so it wasn't approved in any way also). It served only to provide a proof of concept for a new cam design, never actually implemented)
